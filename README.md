# Student Scores Analysis

This project is a Python notebook designed for analyzing student performance data.  
The dataset (`student_scores_large.xlsx`) contains information about student scores, and the notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `notebook.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and modeling.  
- `student_scores_large.xlsx` — Dataset containing student scores.  
- `requirements.txt` — List of dependencies required to run the notebook.  

---

## ⚙️ Installation

Before running the notebook, make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.  
Then, install all dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

To open and run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

Or, if you prefer using VS Code or JupyterLab, simply open the `.ipynb` file and execute the cells in order.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading:** Import and explore the dataset using `pandas`.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Compute statistics and visualize data distributions using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.  
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalization, or feature engineering as required.  
4. **Modeling:** Build and evaluate predictive models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree) using `scikit-learn`.  
5. **Evaluation:** Measure model performance using appropriate metrics and visualize results.
